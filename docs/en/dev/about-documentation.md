# About Documentation

The Mencrouche documentation is the website you are currently viewing. It is a [directory](https://github.com/FOBshippingpoint/mencrouche/tree/main/docs) under the Mencrouche repository, written in Markdown format. To learn Markdown, please refer to [Markdown Tutorial - Introduction](https://commonmark.org/help/tutorial/).

Documentation changes usually come in two forms:

- Improving existing documentation: typo corrections, error fixes and better explanations through clearer writing and examples.
- New documentation: such as tutorials for user-facing features, tutorials for developers, or API updates.

To write documentation, please first [set up the documentation environment](/dev/set-up-doc-environment).
