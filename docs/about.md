# About Mencrouche

Mencrouche is a customizable, easy-to-extend browser start page. You can try it [online](https://mencrouche.com).

## Origin

I'm a big fan of [Markdown New Tab](https://github.com/plibither8/markdown-new-tab), which turns your browser's new tab into a Markdown page. I mainly use it for organizing bookmarks. However, one day I wanted to add a small button with JavaScript, but it wasn't supported. So, I started building Mencrouche to meet my needs.

I also want to shout out to [Anori](https://anori.app/), which inspired me with its "plugin" concept. However, I wasn't satisfied with its grid layout, so Mencrouche used a window-based (sticky) layout instead.
